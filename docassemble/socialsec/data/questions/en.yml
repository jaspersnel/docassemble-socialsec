  This module assists in determining in which member state social security premiums need to be paid in case you are performing activities simultaneously in two or more member states.

  Be aware:
  
  - For taxation one has to look at the applicable tax treaty. This module is not about taxation.
  - This app is according the current applicable rules (Regulation No 883/2004). According to COVID-19 measures the rules can be ignored in case a cross border worker is obliged to work at home due to the crisis. This measure runs until 1 January 2022.
